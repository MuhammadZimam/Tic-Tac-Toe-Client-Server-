**Tic Tac Toe Client-Server App (Console Version)**

This Tic Tac Toe client-server application allows two players to play the classic game of Tic Tac Toe over a network using the console interface. One player acts as the server, hosting the game, while the other player connects to the server as the client.

### Features
- **Client-Server Architecture**: The application follows a client-server architecture, with one player hosting the game as the server and the other player connecting as the client.
- **Turn-Based Gameplay**: Players take turns making their moves on the Tic Tac Toe board until one player wins or the game ends in a draw.
- **Real-Time Communication**: The server facilitates real-time communication between the players, updating the game board for both players after each move.
- **Console Interface**: The game interface is text-based, allowing players to make their moves by entering coordinates in the console.
